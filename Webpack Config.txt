Webpack Config
The main addition in this step is the webpack.config.js file.

You will set a few configuration options in this file. Here is the breakdown for each one, along with a link to the relevant portion of the Webpack docs:

context: This is the path to your client-side JavaScript folder. This must be an absolute path.

entry: This is the entry point for your application.

loaders (module.rules): This section specifies how each file should be processed before it is combined into your bundle. We only have one loader: Babel. This converts your ES6 + JSX JavaScript into ES5 before merging it into your bundle.

resolve: Where Webpack should look for files referenced by an import or require() statement. This makes it so that you can import npm packages in your code.
